What is table extraction?

Table extraction refers to scraping data. This means that StudioX will recognise structured data that is already in a table in the target application or data that has a pattern. When the target information is recognised, it will be separated from the rest of the user interface components and then saved.

How is the table extraction tool used?

Among the UI automation activities, we can find the Extract Table Data activity, which will launch the Table Extraction wizard. The wizard can also be activated from the ribbon menu, similar to the Recorder tool. After extraction, the information can be stored in a variable or transferred to a spreadsheet, including the possibility of a .csv file.

Let's now explore what the wizard can offer and then dive into two real business situations where the tool is very useful.

Data extraction in action: structured information

This project will help us generate a report as a sales rep and the task of the day is to create a sales opportunity report.

The raw data is already available on rpasamples.com/opportunities in tabular form, but they need to manipulate it further in an Excel file. Instead of copying and pasting each item separately, we'll show Jayden how they can prepare their analysis in the blink of an eye, with the help of the table extraction tool!

In developing the automation you'll use the following website:
